Tech Stack: 
Database - PostgreSQL, hosted on Supabase
Backend - Django + Django REST Framework 
Frontend - React 

We decided to use Django due to the monolithic functionality of the framework, such as including an ORM, Admin Panel, built-in Auth, etc. 
Additionally, we decided to use React due to the ease of access and large amounts of existing documentation and features built into the framework. 
Finally, we chose Supabase and PostgresSQL due to Supabase being a popular option to host Postgres databases, and we chose Postgres due to members in the group already being familiar with the technology as a Object Relational Database System, which is required for the design of our App.
